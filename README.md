# Penguin Species Clustering Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify distinct groups within a dataset of penguin measurements collected in Antarctica. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, we attempt to cluster penguins based on their physical characteristics, potentially corresponding to different species.

## Dataset

The dataset `penguins.csv` contains measurements from penguins in Antarctica, collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Antarctica LTER. It includes the following features:

- `culmen_length_mm`: Culmen length (mm)
- `culmen_depth_mm`: Culmen depth (mm)
- `flipper_length_mm`: Flipper length (mm)
- `body_mass_g`: Body mass (g)
- `sex`: Penguin sex

The species of the penguins are not recorded, but it's known that at least three species are native to the region: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables (sex)
   - Normalize numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualize distributions and relationships between features
   - Identify potential outliers

3. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - Apply K-means clustering
   - Experiment with different numbers of clusters
   - Visualize cluster results

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Use PCA or t-SNE for visualization in 2D or 3D space

5. **Interpretation**:
   - Analyze cluster characteristics
   - Compare clusters to known penguin species traits

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for clustering algorithms and preprocessing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
